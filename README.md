# uyghur-chatbot

This is meant to be a RAG enabled chatbot that will provide users with information concerning the Uyghur genocide. 
The current plans are to:
- Upload files, and extract text from them
- Use Pinecone's Canopy framework to handle embedding, retrieval, and chatting
- Use Streamlit to build a simple frontend view
- Host on Huggingface Spaces
